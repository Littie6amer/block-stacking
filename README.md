A block stacking I made for fun and self-educational purposes!\
It is made as a web game using WASM compiled from go.\
You can play this game at https://blocks.littie.xyz (Computer Only)\
This game is expected to be buggy.

All suggestions on how this can be improved are welcome but this project is likely not going to be updated after it is finished.

This repository does not contain the required JS script from Go to allow Go to be operational in the browser as this script may change and it isn't my code.\
You can get it by looking at https://go.dev/wiki/WebAssembly under "Copy the JavaScript support file".
